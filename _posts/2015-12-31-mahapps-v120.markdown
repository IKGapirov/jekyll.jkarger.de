I would like to thank all of you awesome users, testers and contriutors. It was a cool year of MahApps (used at Build 2015, published in magazine, pluralsight course https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/mahappsdotmetro-creating-modern-wpf-apps).

So I think it's time for a new release after over 76000 downloads for v1.1.2!!!

Here is it
