### Short bio

I'm living and working in Germany by [Aachen](https://goo.gl/maps/YVPxbSf9SA42). I was born in east Germany [GDR](https://goo.gl/maps/Epnt9NBgNZp), so I'm also a refugee!

I have [Diabetes mellitus type 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1) since Jan 2015, diagnosed by pure accident.
